In this setting dragon may broadly be split into two primary categories and then four different minor categories in total. They are not defined by their scales but of their ability and how they came into being 


## Wyrm 

The first of the two greater dragons. Without wings and limited limbs they resemble ribbons as they fly through the air. Their power relates to the collection of different living creatures. This could refer to political control, to eugenics, to simply keeping and eye on family lines. 

Wyrms have the strongest control over their element and thus the strongest breathe weapon of all the draconics.

## True Dragon

The second of the true dragons. Baring two wings and four legs the classical dragons are known for convening tools, treasure, or some other object of unique origins.

Though they have a roaring breath weapon comparable to a drake they tend to utilize what items that have collected and their immense brute strength

## Drake

*The Drakes and Whyverns of Miocho by Opotho Hiun*
> [[Al'kili]] has rather strong taste for the different pastries. Because of this they have set up within the town of Penstone. They frequently can be seen walking the streets off to make a large order of a variety of treats and delights. 

Wingless and having four legs the drakes tend to be the grumpiest of the draconics lacking the natural ability to fly.  Drakes will strongly favour different kinds of food. They take great care in this decision as it is directly tied to their abilities and are particularly choosy in taste. 

Drakes have the striking ability that anything that they eat tends to become their breathe weapon. 

*Burnt Borders by Tullir Hiun*
> [[Ji'tonj]] is friend to none. Through a jealous rage that may even rival the [[Mad Kings]] she has hunted a number of unicorns to achieve a right she believes stolen from her. By stuffing unicorn hair between her scales she has achieved a galloping flight. 
> 
> He now travels though both Miocho and Orn in order to search out and challenge other drakes for territory and eating rights.
## Whyvern

> 

Having two wings and two legs a whyvern is known for convening territory. This may come in the form of huge areas they have claimed, to small very specific biomes, to terraforming new land to fit their preference.

They lack a strong breath weapon and instead can only breathe bursts of element relating to the land they control.
