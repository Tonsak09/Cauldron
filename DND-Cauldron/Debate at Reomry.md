The players have been accused of murder and must defend themselves on trial. With little to no experience about the law they must learn to defend themselves quickly. Reomry has a a strict rule to educate all its citizens, so the prison has a library that they can use to learn from. 

But not all is as it seems as the players uncover a plot to assassinate key members of the Ornish Wisdom. Survive the prison, learn in the library, and debate as your lives depend on it.
