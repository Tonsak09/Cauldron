On this time around the players are trying to convince She-Eh-Gi to go back to Clareskir. This should not be too difficult but could lead to them loosing She-Eh-Gi if things go bad very quickly. 

The knights in Echos-Vine will begin ererging but the players will be able to escape due to the outbreak of prisoners. 

Once returning to Clareskir they will be awarded with 
1) 2 x Potion of Invulnerability
2) Potion of Aqueous Form
3) 3 x Wicked Hunter

They will then be asked to go to a safe house for a little time while they set up for the next mission. While meeting with Clareskir they can meet with Martin who is being tasked to work with them for the next phase of the adventure. 

On their way to the safe house they may find **Lilip**, a Firbog knight trying to find a cure for his wife. He is the one that is in charge of the safe house. In the area there is unicorn that he is trying to purse. This may lead to a conflict with the unicorn and JiTonj. 

Before pursuing the unicorn however the party will be brought to the safe house in which a tall 8 foot scarecrow is stood up in front. Surrounding the safe house are fields of corn that are drying up due to the time of year. This inside of the house smells dry and of old dust. There is a half eaten plate of food on the table once they return which Lilip goes and clean without a second thought. 

On the way back to the safe house the players will be told a story regarding the demon behind two doors. They say that if you look between two sets of doors and stare for too long you may attract the attention of a demon who will then attempt to posses someone nearby. They do say however if you are able to capture the creature in a clay jar it will grant you a wish in order to be set free. But do not head its words and those who cut corners sow poor fields. The critter takes on the stats of a hollyphant. 

The players are forbidden to go to a room down the hall as Lilip's wife is very sick according to him and she is not to be disturbed. If anyone tries to enter there They will find an empty and well kept room with photos of a female firbolg with bright red hair and a cheery but timid smile. 

During this time the scarecrow outside will occasionally move and can be seen examining the players. This is naturally the wife who has been cursed to be turned into scarecrow. 

Inside the house the following items can be found
- 2 x Penetrating Elixir
- 17 Gold 
- Photo of Dupik
- Superior Herb
- 3 x Minor Herb 

| Lilip's Shotgun | 2d10 piercing | 10/100 | Ammunition, loading, two handed, heavy, soaked(1) | A  heavy shotgun with two reed barrels. Some combination of two lofters |
| --------------- | ------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
If the players decide to pursue the unicorn they will have some difficulty but will eventually find it in a duel with JiTanj. The player's will have to track the footprints and scrapes of trees along with drake dung.

Once Clareskir returns to the safehouse to inform them about their next mission the players is to go and retrieve Paol Gielby. There is a party revolving around wizards a bit south from Safe-Port. You will have to discover which one is the wizard and then have them let you enter Cauldron. 

Once there the players will have to put on a show spectacular enough to impressive the wizards. This show cannot use any natural magic as they are the most impressed by the use of practical effects. 

Players will then cross a conjured bridge as the three wizards wave them off
- (Cherr) A pregnant woman with a fake beard held up using fishing wire 
- (Albian) A young red-skinned tiefling teen with a rugby cap on. Horns do not show unless the cap is taken off 
- (Krossnoffkin) A large humanoid vampire skeleton 


Once entering Cauldron the players may find it very difficult to traverse. They may come across the following events 
- A wicked afterbirth which will attack them. 
- Lip-Un, a wandering wyvern who "lost her wings". 
- Odd moving water which seems to have a shard of bone "stuck" in it

When leaving the players will be met with a lattice of flowing rivers. The one of the sides south there is a giant outside his home painting. 
- Yulloroth 
- Story of how Cauldron used to be a god that fell once an arch wyvernn stuck into it
- Into the pine woods the players will come across a dungeon once created by angels now gone made
