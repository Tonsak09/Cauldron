A crumbling large stone being carried by cart has been brought back from past [[Cauldron]]. The party has been hired to defend the stone as it is transported to a keep along the border. During their transport of the magic stone players will be ambushed by some bandits hired the [[Ornish Wisdom]] who wish to take the stone for their studies. 

The knights know that the cart is going to be ambushed so they do not want their own people protecting the cart. They are also unsure of the importance of it as it is just one piece that they need to transport. They currently cannot spare people to travel as [[Wicked]] have been more aggressive as of recent. 

## Edit

The party is using the stone in order to get their way into the keep. They must convince the gaurd at the front in order to let them bring it in. 

On the way there the party will be attacked by a group of [jacklewares](https://www.aidedd.org/dnd/monstres.php?vo=jackalwere) and one Ornish [Sharpshooter](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Scout#content). 

They must then find a way to descend to the third floor under. This is were larger monsters are held. Most of the previous two floors contain humans.
