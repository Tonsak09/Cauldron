Along the way to Echos-Vine the party will be traveling across territory made primarily of mangrove trees that connect together by the roots to form solid ground. 

A path has been created using slate stone that is sturdy enough to allow for some foot traffic and light carts. 

## Ambush
Along the way the party may be attacked by an Ornish Sharpshooter along with three jackalweres. They are attempting to steal the post-cauldron stone they are transporting.

If too many little crabs explode or are killed a [giant crab](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Giant%20Crab#content) will appear.  Explosive crabs can explode as a reaction but do not combust if killed. They deal 2d4 fire damage. 
## Hov-Ir
They may also come across an alligator-like [Drake](https://www.aidedd.org/dnd/monstres.php?vo=guard-drake) that may try to take the stone if they reveal the purpose of it. If they don't show the purpose of the stone they may befriend the drake. Hov-ir will demand that they offer tribute to him in the form of a fantastic meal. He is particularly fond of crabs for food.
