A collection of stone manor ruins that lead up to a stone fort on the top of a hill. This is a dangerous area that has been in a primarily conflict area to Cauldron. 

Within the manors...

There are two primary ways to get in. The major gate and the lesser gate. The greater gate is great for leaving through but difficult to get into. The lesser gate is easy to get into but more difficult to leave. 

At the gate to the main keep the players will need to convince a [guard](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16915-guard) to let them past in. There is only one at the lesser gate on the outside while there are five at the greater gate on the inside. 

Inside the lesser gate there are several stopping points where unloaded chests are stored. They are mainly empty and are placed here to storage of the crates. 
## Manor Encounters

- [Spine devil](https://dr-eigenvalue.github.io/bestiary/creature/spined-devil) spy for the Vile. Can be friendly and can possibly make a deal to summon him later. Found pondering many different papers. Some of which are wet. 

The area was once more bustling before the primary attack of the wicked. This was one of the few places on the border in which people could feel relatively safe being around. Now it is overrun and primarily funded by the Ornish Wisdom the continue its operations
