A small war town built upon the border of [[Cauldron]] and [[Miocho]]. Like most of the land bordering Cauldron the ground is primarily made of mud and broken slate stone. This has made the area slippery. Many of the paths use slate stone pads to allow people to step on to avoid the worse of the squelching mud. There are also slate gravel paths for more established areas. 

Because of the constant rain the primary plants that grow in the area are switchgrass and moss. Due to much of the grass being removed the soil in the area has become unstable leading to frequent flooding. East of Bravepoint are more swampy areas where north is mainly tall grassland and mangrove tree roots form solid ground. 

Ducks can be seen around Brave Point. Though one owner made only have a handful they are better than other fowl here due to their ability to float.
