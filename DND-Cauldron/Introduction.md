This is an adventure that has the players explore a new continent discovered past the Goblet Springs. They may be going out in order to feel the thrill of adventure, experience foreign magic, help hunt down the lost cartographer, or something completely else. 

Though the plot is tethered around searching for the cartographer players do not need this to be their character's primary goal.

This is a lower level magic adventure where players start at level 3 but if they wish to have full caster they classes they must have a ratio of 1:2 with "common" magic users being the majority. The following table shows which classes are deemed to the type of magic user they are and the rarity of each class in the world. More x's indicate a higher rarity 

| "Greater" Magic Users                                                                           | "Common" Magic Users                                                                                        |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Bard (xx)<br>Cleric (xxxx)<br>Druid (xxx)<br>Sorcerer (xxxxx)<br>Wizard (xxxx)<br>Warlock(xxxx) | Fighter (x)<br>Barbarian (x)<br>Monk (xxx)<br>Rogue (xx)<br><br>Paladin (xxx)<br>Ranger (x)<br>Artificer(x) |

We have this chart in order to help make the world lean towards a lower magic system but making the magic that players do have access to being significant and rare in the world. If you do feel like you would like to play a full "greater" magic user feel free to make a build like that. These are malleable boundaries used to help us set up the world. 

## Frontier Knights

*Excerpt from Conflicts on the Border of Cauldron*
> A flickering flame exists in all of us that can make the fantastical to become tangible. Some are rewarded burning hearths for their loyalty to beings beyond or some others are lucky enough to be born inheriting from passtorch lineages, but most of us come with mere smoldering embers. Enough perhaps to light a candle on a dark day but not enough to hold against the wicked things that come from the Cauldron. 
> 
> The Frontier Knights are made from the brave men and women that stand against wicked and vile creatures not relying on spellcraft or enchantment but of guns and steel. We are the bulwark and the people of the cities and we are steadfast against all foes.

## Orn

*Excerpt from Empire of Blood by [[Paol Gielby]] 
> Ornish wisdom has gifted us with the modern firearms commonly used. Specially tailored reeds are to be used as the primary mechanism and only once they have reached maturity do we implement the lever action injector. Yes, your rifle is alive and to fire we pump different concoctions into them in order to cause a chemical reaction leading to the ejection of whatever material is in its barrel. 

> Ornish blood merchants have not always been the shunned group that they are today. Due to how integral blood is for the creation of potions and how difficult it can be to get exotic materials in areas where trade lines are weak or nonexistent these merchants have played an integral role in keeping less fortunate populations healthy.

## Wicked 

*Excerpt from Empire of Blood by [[Paol Gielby]] 
> (...) After the horde of wicked finally broke through the Frontier Knight's line at the Echo's Vine the nation of Orn suffered the brunt of the casualties from the creatures as the rampaged through their lands and even made it into Reomry before they were slain and their bodies finally brought back to Cauldron.
