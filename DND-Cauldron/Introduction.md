This is an adventure that has the players explore a new continent discovered past the Goblet Springs. They may be going out in order to feel the thrill of adventure, experience foreign magic, help hunt down the lost cartographer, or something completely else. 

Though the plot is tethered around searching for the cartographer players do not need this to be their character's primary goal.

This adventure has players start with three levels but if they wish to have a "greater" magic class they must have a ratio of 1:2 with "common" magic class being the majority. The following table shows which classes are deemed to the type of magic user they are and the rarity of each class in the world. More x's indicate a higher rarity. 

| "Greater" Magic Users                                                                           | "Common" Magic Users                                                                                        |

| Bard (xx)<br>Cleric (xxxx)<br>Druid (xxx)<br>Sorcerer (xxxxx)<br>Wizard (xxxx)<br>Warlock(xxxx) | Fighter (x)<br>Barbarian (x)<br>Monk (xxx)<br>Rogue (xx)<br><br>Paladin (xxx)<br>Ranger (x)<br>Artificer(x) |

We have this chart in order to make the people of the world feel less naturally magic and require the use of magic potions and items which hopefully play a more significant role in this campaign. If you do feel like you would like to play a full "greater" magic user feel free to make a build like that. These are malleable boundaries used to help us set up the world. 

The rest of this document goes over some factions that you may want your character to come from and a bit of lore to go with it. At the end there is a brief bit about the Wicked who have had a strong influence on the world this campaign takes place in. 

## Frontier Knights

*Excerpt from Conflicts on the Border of Cauldron*
> A flickering flame exists in all of us that can make the fantastical to become tangible. Some are rewarded burning hearths for their loyalty to beings beyond or some others are lucky enough to be born inheriting from passtorch lineages, but most of us come with mere smoldering embers. Enough perhaps to light a candle on a dark day but not enough to hold against the wicked things that come from the Cauldron. 
> 
> The Frontier Knights are made from the brave men and women that stand against wicked and vile creatures not relying on spellcraft or enchantment but of guns and steel. We are the bulwark and the people of the cities and we are steadfast against all foes.

This group is made up of the populations of many different nations who have gone to fight back against the Wicked. They populate the entire border of Cauldron in settles that range from keeps of significant fortitude to glorified campsites.

## Orn

*Excerpt from Empire of Blood by Paol Gielby*
> Ornish wisdom has gifted, or more accurately sold, us with the modern firearms commonly used. Specially tailored reeds are to be used as the primary mechanism and only once they have reached maturity do we implement the lever action injector. Yes, rifles are alive as to fire it is necessary to pump a special blend of concoctions into them in to cause a chemical reaction leading to the ejection of whatever material is in its barrel. 

This nation is currently largest land mass that borders against Cauldron and so is in constant conflict with the Wicked and are the largest funders of the Frontier Knights despite their uneasy relationship.

*Excerpt from Empire of Blood by Paol Gielby*
> Ornish blood merchants have not always been the shunned group that they are today. Due to how integral blood is for the creation of potions and how difficult it can be to get exotic materials in areas where trade lines are weak or nonexistent these merchants have played an integral role in keeping less fortunate populations healthy.

## Wicked 

*Excerpt from Empire of Blood by Paol Gielby*
> (...) After the horde of wicked finally broke through the Frontier Knight's line at the Echo's Vine the nation of Orn suffered the brunt of the casualties from the creatures as the rampaged through their lands and even made it into Reomry before they were slain and their bodies finally brought back to Cauldron.
